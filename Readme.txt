Welcome to my first working project! (i hope)

Im really new to python and programming in general so please if you have any advice or reccomendations for
something i should work on tell me. 

The main file is the file with gui which I wrote with pysimple gui since its the only gui i can make work
at the moment. The no gui concept file was more bainstorming than anything, i only included it in the repository
so people can see the process sort of. It probably wont be a finished script so running it would result in an error
or something.

I made the gui with pysimple gui.
