Welcome to my first working project! (i hope)

This was written using pysimplegui and is dependent on it to run.

There is a nogui script I created for testing the game without a gui to make sure everything worked.

The goal of this game is to guess a password and upon guessing it, theres a suprise at the end. You can press the hint button to give you a hint on what the password might be.
